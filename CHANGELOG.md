## [1.0.0] - 2024-07-22

### Added
- (Include new features or significant user-visible enhancements here.)

### Changed
- Paymail signatures in both Client and Server modules - such that it conforms to existing paymail implementations. They use BS< over the txid not just the txid itself as the msg.
ts-paymail previously used a compact signature over sha256(txid)
go-paymail implementation uses a compact signature over sha256d(Bitcoin Signed Message:\n${txid})
ts-paymail will now conform to go-paymail as this is in line with original documentation hosted by a third party at paymail's launch.
Few people enforce these signatures so no one has noticed until now.
